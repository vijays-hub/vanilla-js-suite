## Problem Statement

You have couple of boxes, ordered in a Grid fashion. The requirements are:
1. On click of each box, it's color should change to green!
2. After you have clicked all the boxes (at this point all boxes are green), then each box should fallback to their
    default color, in the order they were clicked. Meaning, if you clicked on Box3 first, and Box7 last, then Box3
    should fallback to it's default color first and Box7 at the last!
